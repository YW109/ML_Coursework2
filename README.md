# ML_Coursework2
Hi guys.

I've set up a workspace for our project here.

Project spec says needs to be compatible to run in Linux.

Let's try to comment on our commits so we know what we did at which point and why. Any useful or relevant information we could add in the README.

Cheers,

Gerard



Files:

main.py
Python script to load in dataset.

config_example.json
Contains example format for config.json file (not tracked) so individual team members can set their own local
filepath locations without needing to amend the main python file.

alternate_read
Contains a couple of lines to read in all bird labels and part locations into DataFrames for easy viewing. Problem with parsing in the attributes and still working on best way toget image data in the dfs. New csv files can be found in your emails.
