# ML_Coursework2
Hi guys.

I've set up a workspace for our project here.

Project spec says could needs to be compatible to run in Linux.

Let's try to comment on our commits so we know what we did at which point and why. Any useful or relevant information we could add in the README.

Cheers,

Gerard
